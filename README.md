<h1 align="left">Hey there! 👋 I'm Nicholas Lombardo</h1>

###

<h2 align="left">💡 About Me</h2>

<p align="left">
🎓 I'm a Computer Science and Mathematics student at <strong>Cornell University</strong>, passionate about data science, applied math, and solving complex real-world problems.<br><br>

🧪 I'm currently working at <strong>Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS)</strong>, where I use machine learning to predict <strong>pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters</strong> of chemical compounds based on molecular structure.<br>
🌊 Previously, I worked with Cornell’s GeoData project team, using machine learning to predict <strong>Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs)</strong> in Cayuga Lake.<br><br>

🐍 My primary language is Python — I use libraries like <code>NumPy</code>, <code>Pandas</code>, and <code>Scikit-learn</code> daily.<br>
📦 I'm also confident with Java and OCaml, especially in object-oriented and functional programming contexts.<br><br>

🧠 Academically, I’m most excited by topics like linear algebra, group theory, probability, and statistics — and I’m driven to apply these concepts in industry settings.<br><br>

🏌️‍♂️ Outside of class and coding, I unwind by playing golf and working out — both keep me sharp, focused, and energized.<br>
