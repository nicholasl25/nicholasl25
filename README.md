<h2 align="left">Currently Working On</h2>
<p align="left">
<strong>PhysicsSandbox</strong> — a Java-based gravitational dynamics simulator that models celestial body interactions in real-time.  
The project features N-body gravitational simulations with collision detection, elastic and inelastic collisions, planet merging mechanics, and textured celestial bodies with realistic rotation.  
Users can dynamically add planets and point masses with custom properties including mass, radius, velocity, texture, and rotation periods.  
The simulation includes visual features like 3D shading, rotation visualization, and an interactive control panel with both basic and advanced settings.  
Currently implementing black holes using the full general relativity solution to add relativistic gravitational effects beyond the classical Newtonian approximation.  
Created this project to combine my love of physics and computer science through interactive simulation and visualization.

<h2 align="left">About Me</h2>
<p align="left">
I’m a Computer Science and Mathematics student at <strong>Cornell University</strong>, fascinated by the way abstract math and data-driven models can be turned into tools that solve practical problems.  
I enjoy building things that bridge theory and impact. When I’m not coding or working through proofs, you’ll usually find me on the golf course, in the gym, or finding small ways to reset from the academic grind.

At <strong>Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS)</strong>, I develop machine learning models that predict <strong>pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters</strong> of chemical compounds directly from their molecular structure.  
The work combines data science with biomedical research, aiming to anticipate how drugs behave in the human body well before trials begin.

With the <strong>Port Authority of New York and New Jersey</strong>, I worked on forecasting airport passenger volumes at major hubs like JFK and Newark.  
Using <strong>SARIMAX</strong> models, I built forecasts that capture both seasonality and volatility—helping airports better prepare for unpredictable waves of travelers.

Earlier, as part of Cornell’s <strong>GeoData project</strong>, I worked on predicting <strong>Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs)</strong> in Cayuga Lake.  
Most of the time, the lake is harmless, but those rare blooms carry big consequences. Tackling this imbalanced-data problem showed me how machine learning can be adapted to systems where rare events matter most.
