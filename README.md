<h1 align="left">Hey, I’m Nicholas Lombardo</h1>
<h2 align="left">About Me</h2> <p align="left"> I’m a Computer Science and Mathematics student at <strong>Cornell University</strong>, fascinated by the way abstract math and data-driven models can be turned into tools that solve practical problems. I enjoy building things that bridge theory and impact. When I’m not coding or working through proofs, you’ll usually find me on the golf course, in the gym, or finding small ways to reset from the academic grind. </p> <p align="left"> At <strong>Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS)</strong>, I develop machine learning models that predict <strong>pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters</strong> of chemical compounds directly from their molecular structure. The work combines data science with biomedical research, aiming to anticipate how drugs behave in the human body well before trials begin. </p> <p align="left"> With the <strong>Port Authority of New York and New Jersey</strong>, I worked on forecasting airport passenger volumes at major hubs like JFK and Newark. Using <strong>SARIMAX</strong> and <strong>GARCH</strong> models, I built forecasts that capture both seasonality and volatility—helping airports better prepare for unpredictable waves of travelers. </p> <p align="left"> Earlier, as part of Cornell’s <strong>GeoData project</strong>, I worked on predicting <strong>Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs)</strong> in Cayuga Lake. Most of the time the lake is harmless, but those rare blooms carry big consequences. Tackling this imbalanced-data problem showed me how machine learning can be adapted to systems where rare events matter most. </p>

<h2 align="left">Quick Facts</h2> <p align="left"> <strong>Started coding:</strong> 2018<br> <strong>Currently working on:</strong> <em>Hormesis</em>, an app project that explores how social media dynamics can be used to reduce phone addiction and encourage healthier digital habits<br> <strong>Career goal:</strong> Use machine learning and mathematics as powerful tools to understand complex systems and create solutions that make a real difference<br> <strong>Fun fact:</strong> There are about 8.07×10<sup>67</sup> possible ways to shuffle a deck of cards—far more than the number of atoms on Earth </p>
